# GRS-ML_MODEL
This is a part of my MS thesis project titled "Developing a preliminary framework for Gesture detection using Proximity sensors on PSoC".

This repo contains the code of my ML model used to train the gesture dataset (No tap, Single tap and Double tap) using proximity sensor. Two file format has been attached i.e .ipynb ans .py.

The model architecture is made up of Bidirectional- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers, which are specifically used after applying pre-processing step like data augmentation.


# How to Run the Code

# Option 1: Run the notebook in Google Colab
Open `GRS_MODEL.ipynb` and run all cells.

# Option 2: Run the script 'GRS_MODEL.py' locally
